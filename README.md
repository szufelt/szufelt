- 👋 Hi, I’m @szufelt
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general. I find the creation of software to be quite interesting and I'm excited to share projects that I am working on along with exploring other projects in the community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C#, Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
